AudioVision - Object Detection for Visually Impaired with Audio Feedback  

Project Overview  
AudioVision is an AI-powered application that detects objects in real-time and provides "audio feedback" for visually impaired users. It utilizes "YOLOv8, OpenCV, and gTTS API" to enhance accessibility.

Features  
Object Detection: Detects multiple objects in real-time.  
Audio Feedback: Announces detected objects using text-to-speech.  
Pretrained YOLOv8 Model: Efficient and accurate object detection.  
User-Friendly: Simple and lightweight implementation.
